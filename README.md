# HeliFlight Configurator

HeliFlight Configurator is a crossplatform configuration tool for the HeliFlight flight control system.

HeliFlight Configurator is forked from Betaflight Configurator.


## Installation

### Standalone

**This is the default installation method, and at some point in the future this will become the only way available for most platforms. Please use this method whenever possible.**

Download the installer from [Releases.](https://github.com/heliflight3d/heliflight-configurator/releases)

#### Note for MacOS X users

Changes to the security model used in the latest versions of MacOS X 10.14 (Mojave) and 10.15 (Catalina) mean that the operating system will show an error message ('"Heliflight Configurator.app" is damaged and canâ€™t be opened. You should move it to the Trash.') when trying to install the application. To work around this, run the following command in a terminal after installing: `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Betaflight\ Configurator.app`.


## Native app build via NW.js (windows/linux/macos) or Cordova (android)

### Development

1. Install node.js (version 10 required)
2. Install yarn: `npm install yarn -g`
3. (For Android platform only) Install Java JDK 8, Gradle and Android Studio (Android SDK at least level 19)
4. Change to project folder and run `yarn install`.
5. Run `yarn start`.

### Running tests

`yarn test`

### App build and release

The tasks are defined in `gulpfile.js` and can be run with through yarn:
```
yarn gulp <taskname> [[platform] [platform] ...]
```

List of possible values of `<task-name>`:
* **dist** copies all the JS and CSS files in the `./dist` folder [2].
* **apps** builds the apps in the `./apps` folder [1].
* **debug** builds debug version of the apps in the `./debug` folder [1][3].
* **release** zips up the apps into individual archives in the `./release` folder [1]. 

[1] Running this task on macOS or Linux requires Wine, since it's needed to set the icon for the Windows app (build for specific platform to avoid errors).
[2] For Android platform, **dist** task will generate folders and files in the `./dist_cordova` folder.
[3] For Android platform, you need to configure an emulator or to plug an Android device with USB debugging enabled

#### Build or release app for one specific platform
To build or release only for one specific platform you can append the plaform after the `task-name`.
If no platform is provided, all the platforms will be done in sequence.

* **MacOS X** use `yarn gulp <task-name> --osx64`
* **Linux** use `yarn gulp <task-name> --linux64`
* **Windows** use `yarn gulp <task-name> --win32`
* **ChromeOS** use `yarn gulp <task-name> --chromeos`
* **Android** use `yarn gulp <task-name> --android`

You can also use multiple platforms e.g. `yarn gulp <taskname> --osx64 --linux64`.

## Languages

HeliFlight Configurator has been translated into several languages. The application will try to detect and use your system language if a translation into this language is available. You can help [translating the application into your language](https://github.com/heliflight3d/heliflght/tree/master/README.md#Translators);

If you prefer to have the application in English or any other language, you can select your desired language in the first screen of the application.

## Notes

### Graphics Issues

If you experience graphics display problems or smudged/dithered fonts display issues in Betaflight Configurator, try invoking the betaflight-configurator executable file with the --disable-gpu command line switch. This will switch off hardware graphics acceleration. Likewise, setting your graphics card antialiasing option to OFF (e.g. FXAA parameter on NVidia graphics cards) might be a remedy as well.

### Linux users

In most Linux distributions your user won't have access to serial interfaces by default. To add this access right type the following command in a terminal, log out your user and log in again:

```
sudo usermod -aG dialout ${USER}
```

### Linux / MacOS X users

If you have 3D model animation problems, enable "Override software rendering list" in Chrome flags chrome://flags/#ignore-gpu-blacklist
